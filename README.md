people-quotes-app
=================

Purpose: Android application to display a currently limited amount of quotes

Version 1
---------

Created static xml files for each quote and used buttons to switch between views and activities.

Learning: Essentially how xml and layouts in Android work. Gained a rudimentary understanding of the activity lifecycle.

Version 2
---------

Complete rewrite that will:
  - reuse a single layout for all quotes
  - make use of a card layout style to display quotes
  - change layout for main screen so that quotes are not immediately displayed
  - read from the device's local DB when displaying quotes
  - write quotes to local DB on install
